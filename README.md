- [Time Series Data Prediction]

    ([https://github.com/dharvpat/time-series-data-prediction-SSM]):Using State Space Models to perform Statistical Approximation of Time Series data. This methodology works extremely well when the cause of change in the data is something unpredictable like People, Supply/Demand, Weather Patterns, etc.

    ([https://github.com/dharvpat/SVM-Time-series-data-prediction]):Using Support Vector Machines to perform Numerical Approximation of Time Series data. This methodology works extremely well when the cause of change in the data is something predictable like Nature or any other physical processes.

    ([https://github.com/dharvpat/LSTM_stock_prediciton]):Using Long Short Term Memory RNNs to perform Deep Learning Modeling of Time Series data. This methodology works extremely well when the cause of change in the data is a Recurrent Process. This is particularly accurate for stock data as any changes in the prices recursively changes the price further.


- [Papers in code]
    ([https://github.com/dharvpat/Papers-in-code/tree/main/A%20survey%20on%20deep%20reinforcement%20learning]): Reinforcement Learning using both DQN and A3C methodologies. We explore Transfer Learning as well as Trust Region Policy Optimization and Proximal Policy Optimization.
    ([https://github.com/dharvpat/Papers-in-code/tree/main/Attention%20is%20all%20you%20need]): Reinforcement Learning using both DQN and A3C methodologies. We explore Transfer Learning as well as Trust Region Policy Optimization and Proximal Policy Optimization.
- [Project Three](https://github.com/dharvpat/project-three): A brief description of project three.
