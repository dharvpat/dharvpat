# üëã Hi there, I'm Dharv Patel!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate software developer and data enthusiast with a keen interest in machine learning, natural language processing, and neural networks. My journey in technology began with a curiosity about how data can be harnessed to solve real-world problems, leading me to dive deep into the realms of AI and data science.

## üöÄ My Journey

From tinkering with simple Python scripts during my college days to building complex machine learning models, I started working on code in a scientific environment, namely, physics. In this job, I came across image processing and that led me to do a deep dive on image processing. In this, I learned about CUDA, and Vision Transformers, wanting to streamline our code, I implemented a straigh-off-the-shelf Vision Transformer which was very overkill for the purposes of the Project. This is why my journey started with a focus on data/statistics driven approaches(As seen in the projects below). Soon after, I came across deep learning models through which I was mesmerized by the bounds of AI (Also showcased below). This led me to pursue a master's in AI, which exposed me to variety of different but equally interesting niches of ML/AI. I've explored all of the niches I've encountered and am still passionate about AI as a whole.

These niches were interesting but challenging nonetheless, Each of the following projects took solid effort to build sometimes spanning months or years. Despite the challenges, each project has been a rewarding learning experience that has strengthened my problem-solving abilities and technical expertise. I am committed to continuing this journey, eager to take on new challenges and contribute to innovative solutions across a variety of fields including but not limited to Computer Vision and Signal Processing (As shown by my project doing a deepdive into Image Compression and Noise Cancellation in a chaotic signal).

### üìà **Key Projects**
