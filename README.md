# üëã Hi there, I'm Dharv Patel!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate software developer and data enthusiast with a keen interest in machine learning, natural language processing, and neural networks. My journey in technology began with a curiosity about how data can be harnessed to solve real-world problems, leading me to dive deep into the realms of AI and data science.

## üöÄ My Journey

From tinkering with simple Python scripts during my college days to building complex machine learning models, my journey in coding began in a scientific environment‚Äîspecifically, physics. In this role, I encountered image processing, which sparked a deep dive into the field. Through this exploration, in a very short time, I mastered technologies like **CUDA** and **Vision Transformers**. Seeking to streamline our workflow, I implemented a straight-off-the-shelf Vision Transformer, which was initially overkill for the project's needs. However, I was astonished by the model's performance, and this experience left me mesmerized by the limitless possibilities of AI.

This pivotal moment led me to pursue a master's degree in AI, where I was exposed to a variety of intriguing niches within artificial intelligence. I've delved into each of these areas and remain passionate about AI as a whole, with a particular focus on **Machine Learning**.

These niches have been both fascinating and challenging. Each of the following projects required substantial effort, often spanning months or years. Despite the challenges, each endeavor has been a rewarding learning experience, strengthening my problem-solving abilities and technical expertise. I am committed to continuing this journey, eager to take on new challenges and contribute to innovative solutions across various fields, as demonstrated by my projects below.
